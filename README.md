# Animating-Merge-Sort-Algorithm-with-Python

Learning to program graphical interfaces can be very attractive and intuitive when practical examples are used. This project does just that by animating the Merge Sort algorithm with Python, using the PySide6 library.  This project is a great way to understand the GUI implementation and inner workings of the Merge Sort algorithm. The interface is easy to use which makes understanding the concept easier and more fun.
